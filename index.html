hello, world!
I make Roblox games and math libraries
    
2/7/2023
    Woke up with dry eyes and a sneeze. Drank the night before.
    Cor Fidelis:
        Wrote an enumeration module to make enums easier and cleaner.
        Switched input requests to be only pure keyboard/mouse/dt inputs.
        Got started on a Movement module for player movement, but after trying some new ideas, they are failing horribly. I have more ideas, and I'll figure it out eventually.
        I want it to have the property where it keeps your head a constant height above the surface when accelerating along a ramp / stairs.
        A spring of the form f'' = -s^2 f - 2 s f' has a delay of 2/s units of time behind a constant velocity target.
