hello, world!
I make Roblox games and math libraries

    Martin wasted most of my time ;)
    Cor Fidelis:
        Realized that the new movement idea is not very good on its own.
            Will consider augmenting it to increase accuracy of when to pull the player down.
        Implemented InputHandler, where we will now interpret raw inputs from the player.
        Mobile controller will be implemented as to emulate hardware. Maybe context sensitive controls in the future, who knows.
        Implemented LookAngles which accumulates mouse delta. It's alright.
            Should probably be implemented directly into the movemnet module
    Lined up 6 tweets for the next three days dealing with application of getPureYAngle, and quaternions, and quaternion projection.
    Added more files to the github.

    Woke up with dry eyes and a sneeze. Drank with Arthur the night before.
    Cor Fidelis:
        Wrote an enumeration module to make enums easier and cleaner.
        Switched input requests to be only pure keyboard/mouse/dt inputs.
        Got started on a Movement module for player movement, but after trying some new ideas, they are failing horribly. I have more ideas, and I'll figure it out eventually.
        I want it to have the property where it keeps your head a constant height above the surface when accelerating along a ramp / stairs.
        A spring of the form f'' = -s^2 f - 2 s f' has a delay of 2/s units of time behind a constant velocity target.
    I made a twitter post about projecting an arbitrary rotation onto a cardinal axis of rotation.
    I then generalized it to any axis of rotation for the first time.
    I opened a new respository on github called Math-Gems where I will be posting nice math code.
    I think I will make a tweet and post a new file to the repository when I find a nice new mathematical thing.
