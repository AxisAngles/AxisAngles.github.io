hello, world!
I make Roblox games and math libraries

5/29/2023
    Two days ago was Felix's birthday. We cuddled, went to the Folklife Festival, cuddled, and got Sushi at Umi Sake House.
    Upon getting to Seattle Center, we got off the sidewalk, and instead opted to climb our way down through the concrete terraced shrubbery.
    Folklife was I think more of a pillar in Felix's life when he was homeless and it provided boundless free food.
    But there were cool vendors there selling cool crafts. We got him a winged orca. It was interesting to hear about how much the location had changed.
    The sushi restaurant was a winner. Omakase sashimi, and two very good rolls, though one, the Mona Lisa, was perhaps a bit too spicy for Felix.
    
    Yesterday was good.
    I implemented Pure modules which implies they are not supposed to hold state. No function(env) wrapper needed for those!
    I looked at the Incenter.push code for like 4 hours, and ended up changing like three 0's into 1e-4's. Whatever works, you know.
    Rhys, Harrison and I ended up playing Overwatch until 1AM or so. Rhys has found a healing character that he is very good with.
    He's very smart and has great situational awareness, so healing role is good for him.
    And then Rhys and I implemented exact geometric physics representations of Roblox cylindars and sphere meshes.

    Two days ago, I spent the day prototyping an autolean feature which tries to maintain line of sight.
    It works pretty OK but it's a little jarring and I think I can make some improvements to it.
    
    More importantly, yesterday, I went to break up with Felix, but we ended up not doing that and instead we're going to try to work on our problems.
    It's pretty emotional and I don't really know what I'm doing.

5/22/2023
    It's been a while!
    I've held a very bad sleep schedule recently, and today I was woken up by a wrong-number phone call by a contractor.
    We half-implemented bipod mounting, but I have a better general idea. Automatic leaning, that tries to keep the path of the barrel and immediately in front of the barrel clear.
    We will try this tomorrow to see how it goes.
    
    Several days ago, Rubie uploaded a video about Cor Fi, and expressed confidence in the game.re
    We've been getting increased traffic to it since. I don't know how much longevity it will have, but it sure it nice for motivation and testing.

    Harrison has bought so many guns this past two months, it's hilarious and cool.
    
    
3/14/2023
    I'll make an attempt to remember what went on since the last time I wrote.
    I have been very tired but two days ago, I felt the best I had been in two weeks.
    I've neglected sleep the last two nights though, and we also sprang forward an hour yesterday.
    2/27
        Harrison put in an order for an M9A4 hand gun and a AK. The AK is quality. It has wood furniture, which Harrison did not like initially, but I think it has grown on him.
        He put in this order because there is an impending "assault weapons ban" here in Washington.
    2/28
        Harrison had his birthday. I drove him to the airport so that he could see his parents.
        Right after I dropped him off, I drove straight up to Canada to see Rhys.
        He has a real matress now in the guest bedroom, which was a gift from his parents.
        It was much nicer to sleep on and really made me feel like I was in a home, haha.
        He had finished the kitchen countertops, and the bathtub had been replaced since the last time I was there.
        I took him in the miata with the top down to Whole Foods to get some cheese and things.
        He made the comment "I've don't think I've ever driven in the winter with the top down."
        We learned that night that he does not like blue cheese.
    3/1
        I was so tired that day, and getting more tired as time went on, so we drove down to Bellevue that night.
        In bellevue, we hung out and worked a bit.
        I pointed out to Rhys that he could move some code from RenderStepped over to Heartbeat.
        We discovered that Stepped only runs at the physics rate (no faster than 240 hz).
	        Now we will entierly ignore Stepped on the client, and probably on the server, too, on principle.
        Rhys tried to use his custom build system to build and push the code. It worked but he didn't think it did.
            Roblox changed their publish response code, and so it worked, but the response code was not recognized by the build system.
    3/2 - now
        Conceptualized a way to prevent lagging due to encode/decode. That is:
            Copy object first, as it is 5x to 10x faster than encode.
            Then encode it on the server over several frames.
            Then decode it on the client over several frames.
            Resync over the course of several frames.
        I improved the encode algorithm:
            It only does debug checking when in studio. This is good for perf.
            The debug check is breadth first so that it can show you the shortest path to the problem.
            The internal loop became much cleaner and a bit faster, too.
        I found a bug in the way we were registering functions and tables:
            1) not all tables inside a class should be recursively registered automatically
            2) If there were two paths to the same function, the server might register one path, but the client might register the other path
            3) attempting to register boolean values LOL.
        I improved pretty print for debugging. It's been a bit helpful so far, which is nice.
        I wrote code to convert animations from the edit format to a new fast format
            The new fast format is more than 3x smaller.
            Has better memory locality reducing cache misses and improving binary search time.
            It unitizes the animations, they all play from time 0 to 1.
        I wrote a new KeyFrameAnimationRender function that makes use of the new animation format, and does everything in CFrames instead of QFrames.
        The speed up from both of these is on the order of 3x.
        Re-encoding takes almost no time at all.
            When we move this code over to the animation editor, we will be keeping the edit format, but we'll probably just convert the edit format into the fast format for playback.
            It takes 3ms to convert every animation in the game to the fast format right now, so it should be fast enough.
        I found some bugs in the animations.
            Sometimes the bone's animation stack counter would not be reset because of an early exiting guard clause.
            When I wrote the converter, I scaled the time, unitT = (t - t0)/(t1 - t0). I was braindead and wrote v = v/(t1 - t0) instead of v*(t1 - t0).
            That was a 2.5 hour bug fixing session to turn a / into a *. The embarassing part is that I found it immediately and thought "there's no way that can be wrong."
        Harrison and I added sway, walk bob, the sprint animation, and the reloading animation, using the new system. It's quite beautiful.
        Animations are way more powerful now than they were in the previous builds.
    3/6
        Some time between then, Alex came up from San Francisco. We had avery good time. Felix came over too on the 6th, the same day Harrison got back from the trip.
        We went to the gun range. We had a good time. Rhys found a goal at the range and probably unloaded more ammo than most americans do in their lifetimes.
        Felix apparently had never operated a gun outside of aiming and pulling the trigger. I didn't realize that! So I showed him how to load and operate my little 1911.
        Alex introduced me to Death Note and it's pretty neat.
        Felix and I cuddled a bit while we watched a very funny kung fu parody film that Alex had put on.
        Alex and Felix stayed up very late talking. I went to bed early becaue I was very tired and started crashing.
        I found out the next morning that Alex drove him home. I'm glad they like each other.
        
        Alex and Rhys later left for Canada. Alex later spent the night on his way back from Canada to San Fran.

2/26/2023
    This was a busy day for me, though I did not get much done.
    We are just changing the architecture of the moduleLoader and animations to support a better API.
    I suspect I have a vitamin deficiency. I'm trying very hard to get good sleep, going to bed at midnight every night, and yet I am still tired.
    I'm going to go pick up some supplements. B12, D, and fish oil. I'll take these for 2 weeks and see if there are any improvements.

2/25/2023
    Fixed more QoL features of Cor and got started on designing the new animation tech.
    This was the night of the FetchNW event with Felix. I picked him up in the Miata and he asked me some questions about the car on the way there.
    I enjoy when he has an interest in cars and things. The drive over there with Felix was more enjoyable than the event itself. Mostly I was tired.
    Even though I didn't care to meet anyone new, I did meet a cool person who teaches CS on VRChat, who knew me and said I was iconic which is really sweet.

2/24/2023
    I had recovered enough from sleep to begin on work, so we started working on Cor again. Making QoL changes to the architecture.
    That night, we took the Miata and Corolla out for some faster driving. We found a really neat road we can race around, probably to the dismay of the homeowners.

2/23/2023
    I cannot remember all that has happened in the past two weeks, but I will try my best.
    2/11 - Went skiing. Emma said my carving form looked pretty good. Still lots of room to grow.
        I went shirtless because it was relatively warm (40s) and the sun was out.
        This got a lot of complements and comments, though that was not the intention.
        I was already considering going shirtless, but when I looked at Arthur's layers and started counting them, he said not to reveal his belly to the public.
        This encouraged me to take off my shirt to show him up and also cool myself down at the same time.
        We did not see James and the rest of thr group very much, but we did meet for lunch.
        Arthur stayed only this day.
        At the end of the day, we went to the hotel and hung out. The group was James, Harrison, Lee and myself.
        Lee and I talked about math and tokens and parsing, among other things.
        I was still tired this day, and I did not get great sleep that night.
        James's friend, Shane, chipped his tooth, so he went home for the day. Hope he is OK.
        He was going to room with Harrison, so I got my own room, and then Harrison ended up getting his own room, too.
    2/12
        More skiing. We got breakfast together, but it took a long time for Harrison to get down. Neither James, Lee or I got much sleep at the hotel.
        Tried a black diamond, but my skill was not good enough, my confidence was not great enough, and my skis were too long (at my skill level) for me to effectively take the moguls.
        We tried another black diamond which was ok, more like a blue down in Lake Tahoe.
        About half way through, I was tired and wanted to stop but I ended up going back out there to make use of my time on the slopes.
        No personal injuries.
    2/13 - 17
        I do not remember but some time in here, I got really tired. Felix and I were to go to the zoo, on I think the 15th, but we stayed up really late instead.
    2/18
        Harrison and I had a conversation about driving manual, and I decided that I wanted to get a miata.
        We spent several hours looking at the used Miata market, and found a white 2017 RF model for sale on craigslist.
        I contacted the seller by email and he replied that night, that he would be available for test drive on Monday.
    2/19
        Harrison and I shot our pistols at Wade's gun range. His pistol feels pretty good. I love mine.
        The small 380 auto goes for 1100 now. I picked up mine for 750 in 2017.
    2/21
        Monday came and we were to test drive the miata. Felix came just in time to the apartment to go check out the miata.
        I did not know how to drive a manual, so Harrison test drove it for me. We hung out in a parkinglot of a church to learn.
        Felix stayed in Harrison's car, and I felt bad. I asked Harrison to offer Felix driving lessons in the Camry but they were refused.        

2/10/2023
    Was tired again today, even though I made an attempt to get sleep.
    Ran errands, bought Timberland boots, got lunch with Felix, ran laundry.
    Packed for ski trip, queued alignCFrame method on Twitter for Sunday.

2/9/2023
    Went to bed last night at 3:30am
    woke up at 8:00am to get breakfast with Arthur at Chase's Pancake Corral at 9:00am.
    Arthur and I then went to Wade's gun store just to look around.
    Harrison woke up shortly therafter, and his 1911 was ready for pickup 30 minutes North at Sportsman's Warehouse in Everett.
    My Quaternion/Matrix etc libraries were merged into SlimeVR's main branch!!
    We went up to pick up his gun, and I got a 1911 380 magazine.
    I was not productive on Cor today because I was so tired.
    I don't want to play videogames, I'm disatisfied with all FPSs right now.
    I don't want to message people, I don't want want to be on social media.
    I don't want to work, I don't have the energy to problem solve now.
    I am just feeling very down today.


2/8/2023
    Martin wasted most of my time ;)
    Cor Fidelis:
        Realized that the new movement idea is not very good on its own.
            Will consider augmenting it to increase accuracy of when to pull the player down.
        Implemented InputHandler, where we will now interpret raw inputs from the player.
        Mobile controller will be implemented as to emulate hardware. Maybe context sensitive controls in the future, who knows.
        Implemented LookAngles which accumulates mouse delta. It's alright.
            Should probably be implemented directly into the movemnet module
    Lined up 6 tweets for the next three days dealing with application of getPureYAngle, and quaternions, and quaternion projection.
    Added more files to the github.
        
    
2/7/2023
    Woke up with dry eyes and a sneeze. Drank with Arthur the night before.
    Cor Fidelis:
        Wrote an enumeration module to make enums easier and cleaner.
        Switched input requests to be only pure keyboard/mouse/dt inputs.
        Got started on a Movement module for player movement, but after trying some new ideas, they are failing horribly. I have more ideas, and I'll figure it out eventually.
        I want it to have the property where it keeps your head a constant height above the surface when accelerating along a ramp / stairs.
        A spring of the form f'' = -s^2 f - 2 s f' has a delay of 2/s units of time behind a constant velocity target.
    I made a twitter post about projecting an arbitrary rotation onto a cardinal axis of rotation.
    I then generalized it to any axis of rotation for the first time.
    I opened a new respository on github called Math-Gems where I will be posting nice math code.
    I think I will make a tweet and post a new file to the repository when I find a nice new mathematical thing.
