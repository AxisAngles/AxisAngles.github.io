    hello, world!<br>
    I make Roblox games and math libraries<br>
    2/7/2023 - Woke up with dry eyes and a sneeze. Drank the night before.<br>
    Cor Fidelis:<br>
    Wrote an enumeration module to make enums easier and cleaner.<br>
    Switched input requests to be only pure keyboard/mouse/dt inputs.<br>
    Got started on a Movement module for player movement, but after trying some new ideas, they are failing horribly. I have more ideas, and I'll figure it out eventually.<br>
    I want it to have the property where it keeps your head a constant height above the surface when accelerating along a ramp / stairs.<br>
    A spring of the form f'' = -s^2 f - 2 s f' has a delay of 2/s units of time behind a constant velocity target.<br>
