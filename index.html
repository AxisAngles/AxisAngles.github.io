hello, world!
I make Roblox games and math libraries

2/26/2023
    This was a busy day for me, though I did not get much done.
    We are just changing the architecture of the moduleLoader and animations to support what we want to do.

2/25/2023
    Fixed more QoL features of Cor and got started on designing the new animation tech.
    This was the night of the FetchNW event with Felix. I picked him up in the Miata and he asked me some questions about the car on the way there.
    I enjoy when he has an interest in cars and things. The drive over there with Felix was more enjoyable than the event itself. Mostly I was tired.
    Even though I didn't care to meet anyone new, I did meet a cool person who teaches CS on VRChat, who knew me and said I was iconic which is really sweet.

2/24/2023
    I had recovered enough from sleep to begin on work, so we started working on Cor again. Making QoL changes to the architecture.
    That night, we took the Miata and Corolla out for some faster driving. We found a really neat road we can race around, probably to the dismay of the homeowners.

2/23/2023
    I cannot remember all that has happened in the past two weeks, but I will try my best.
    2/11 - Went skiing. Emma said my carving form looked pretty good. Still lots of room to grow.
        I went shirtless because it was relatively warm (40s) and the sun was out.
        This got a lot of complements and comments, though that was not the intention.
        I was already considering going shirtless, but when I looked at Arthur's layers and started counting them, he said not to reveal his belly to the public.
        This encouraged me to take off my shirt to show him up and also cool myself down at the same time.
        We did not see James and the rest of thr group very much, but we did meet for lunch.
        Arthur stayed only this day.
        At the end of the day, we went to the hotel and hung out. The group was James, Harrison, Lee and myself.
        Lee and I talked about math and tokens and parsing, among other things.
        I was still tired this day, and I did not get great sleep that night.
        James's friend, Shane, chipped his tooth, so he went home for the day. Hope he is OK.
        He was going to room with Harrison, so I got my own room, and then Harrison ended up getting his own room, too.
    2/12
        More skiing. We got breakfast together, but it took a long time for Harrison to get down. Neither James, Lee or I got much sleep at the hotel.
        Tried a black diamond, but my skill was not good enough, my confidence was not great enough, and my skis were too long (at my skill level) for me to effectively take the moguls.
        We tried another black diamond which was ok, more like a blue down in Lake Tahoe.
        About half way through, I was tired and wanted to stop but I ended up going back out there to make use of my time on the slopes.
        No personal injuries.
    2/13 - 17
        I do not remember but some time in here, I got really tired. Felix and I were to go to the zoo, on I think the 15th, but we stayed up really late instead.
    2/18
        Harrison and I had a conversation about driving manual, and I decided that I wanted to get a miata.
        We spent several hours looking at the used Miata market, and found a white 2017 RF model for sale on craigslist.
        I contacted the seller by email and he replied that night, that he would be available for test drive on Monday.
    2/19
        Harrison and I shot our pistols at Wade's gun range. His pistol feels pretty good. I love mine.
        The small 380 auto goes for 1100 now. I picked up mine for 750 in 2017.
    2/21
        Monday came and we were to test drive the miata. Felix came just in time to the apartment to go check out the miata.
        I did not know how to drive a manual, so Harrison test drove it for me. We hung out in a parkinglot of a church to learn.
        Felix stayed in Harrison's car, and I felt bad. I asked Harrison to offer Felix driving lessons in the Camry but they were refused.        

2/10/2023
    Was tired again today, even though I made an attempt to get sleep.
    Ran errands, bought Timberland boots, got lunch with Felix, ran laundry.
    Packed for ski trip, queued alignCFrame method on Twitter for Sunday.

2/9/2023
    Went to bed last night at 3:30am
    woke up at 8:00am to get breakfast with Arthur at Chase's Pancake Corral at 9:00am.
    Arthur and I then went to Wade's gun store just to look around.
    Harrison woke up shortly therafter, and his 1911 was ready for pickup 30 minutes North at Sportsman's Warehouse in Everett.
    My Quaternion/Matrix etc libraries were merged into SlimeVR's main branch!!
    We went up to pick up his gun, and I got a 1911 380 magazine.
    I was not productive on Cor today because I was so tired.
    I don't want to play videogames, I'm disatisfied with all FPSs right now.
    I don't want to message people, I don't want want to be on social media.
    I don't want to work, I don't have the energy to problem solve now.
    I am just feeling very down today.

    Martin wasted most of my time ;)
    Cor Fidelis:
        Realized that the new movement idea is not very good on its own.
            Will consider augmenting it to increase accuracy of when to pull the player down.
        Implemented InputHandler, where we will now interpret raw inputs from the player.
        Mobile controller will be implemented as to emulate hardware. Maybe context sensitive controls in the future, who knows.
        Implemented LookAngles which accumulates mouse delta. It's alright.
            Should probably be implemented directly into the movemnet module
    Lined up 6 tweets for the next three days dealing with application of getPureYAngle, and quaternions, and quaternion projection.
    Added more files to the github.
        
    
2/7/2023
    Woke up with dry eyes and a sneeze. Drank with Arthur the night before.
    Cor Fidelis:
        Wrote an enumeration module to make enums easier and cleaner.
        Switched input requests to be only pure keyboard/mouse/dt inputs.
        Got started on a Movement module for player movement, but after trying some new ideas, they are failing horribly. I have more ideas, and I'll figure it out eventually.
        I want it to have the property where it keeps your head a constant height above the surface when accelerating along a ramp / stairs.
        A spring of the form f'' = -s^2 f - 2 s f' has a delay of 2/s units of time behind a constant velocity target.
    I made a twitter post about projecting an arbitrary rotation onto a cardinal axis of rotation.
    I then generalized it to any axis of rotation for the first time.
    I opened a new respository on github called Math-Gems where I will be posting nice math code.
    I think I will make a tweet and post a new file to the repository when I find a nice new mathematical thing.
